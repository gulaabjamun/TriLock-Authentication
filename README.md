TriLock Authentication – Graphical Password System

A secure and intuitive graphical password-based authentication system where users can click three points on an image to set and verify their password.
Instead of typing characters, the login is performed visually, making it more user-friendly and resistant to traditional password attacks.

Features:
1. Click-based authentication system
2. 3-point graphical password setup
3. Image-based login mechanism
4. Coordinate tolerance for flexibility
5. Easy and interactive UI
6. Higher security than text passwords
7. Hard to brute-force or dictionary attack

How it Works:
Step 1: User selects an image for password setup.
Step 2: User clicks three specific points on the image → Saved as password.
Step 3: For login, user must click the same three points in the same sequence.
Step 4: If the coordinates match within a tolerance range → Access Granted.
